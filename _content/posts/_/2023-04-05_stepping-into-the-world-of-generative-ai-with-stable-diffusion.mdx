There's so much hype around Generative AI these days, fresh off the heels of the metaverse cool down, largely due in part to the release of ChatGPT-4 by OpenAI ([a Microsoft partner](https://openai.com/blog/openai-and-microsoft-extend-partnership)) in March 2023. Unless you've been living under a rock, I'm sure you've heard about all its greatness and faults.
<br />
It's certainly opened my eyes to the world of Generative AI, and I thought it might bring value to humans of the internet if I shared my impressions and learning experiences as I navigate the world of Generative AI through Stable Diffusion. So here we go, but first...

## What is Generative AI?

Good question. Let's ask ChatGPT.

> a type of artificial intelligence capable of creating new and original content, such as images, videos, and text using complex algorithms...

That's quite good, actuallyâ€” in layman's terms, it's a program that learns on its own (that's the _deep learning_ part) and applies what it's learned to perform a task, like answering my question above. I see it as the pinnacle of [biomimetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomimetics), as we're training computers to learn the way humans do, or rather the way babies do, except, much quicker and with unlimited access to knowledge available on the internet. It's a both terrifying and exciting at the same time, and will most definitely change the way we live for the next 20 years.

## What is Stable Diffusion?

Stable Diffusion is a deep learning text-to-image generator created by [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/), which means you can prompt the AI with words and it will spit out an image. It's not the only text-to-image generator, there's also- [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) (created by the co-founder of Leap Motion) and [DALL-E](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2) (OpenAI), however of the options, it's the only open source option. That's why I decided to go with Stable Diffusion, as I'm an advocate for open source.
<br />
Next, I'll get into the my setup.


## Setting up Stable Diffusion

_Note: I'm setting up Stable Diffusion on my Mac Mini M1._
<br />

There's an amazing github repo [`AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui`](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) which I will be utilizing. In the Wiki section, it goes over the [installation instructions for Mac Silicon](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Installation-on-Apple-Silicon#automatic-installation), and I'll reiterate the steps below:

1. Make sure you have `brew` set up. If not, [get it](https://brew.sh).
2. Install `cmake`, `protobuf`, `rust`, `python@3.10`, `git`, `wget`:
```sh
brew install cmake protobuf rust python@3.10 git wget
```
_Note: I used [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install the specified version of Python, in case you too need to manage multi versions of Python._
