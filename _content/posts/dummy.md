I just want to say

## Hi

<Slides>

It was all a dream.

```jsx
const a = 20
const b = 30
console.log(a + b) // 50
```

---

```jsx App.js preview
export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <p>yo</p>
      <h1 style={{ color: 'red' }}>
        Hello React
      </h1>
    </>
  )
}
```

glad to have you here.

</Slides>
